# Environment
+ Python[3.6.12]
+ Pytorch[1.7.1]
+ GPU (GeForce RTX 2080 Ti) & (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090) & (Quadro RTX 8000)

# Hyperparameters
+ The learning rates of USPS, HHAR, ACM, and DBLP datasets are set to 0.001, and the learning rates of Reuters and CiteSeer datasets are set to 0.0001. lambda1 and lambda2 are set to {1000, 1000} for USPS, {1, 0.1} for HHAR, {10, 10} for Reuters, and {0.1, 0.01} for graph datasets.

# To run code
+ Step 1: set the hyperparameters for the specific dataset;
+ Step 2: python AGCN.py --name [data_name]
* For examle, if u would like to run AGCN on the usps dataset, u need to
* first set {1000, 1000} for USPS;
* then run the command "python AGCN.py --name usps"
